# Market Data Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem
Agent was unable to access market data:
```
Market Data: ‚ùå Subscription restrictions prevent access to recent market data
Status: Cannot analyze opportunities without price data
```

**Root Cause:** Alpaca's `get_market_data` tool requires paid subscription for historical bar data.

---

## Solution
Configured agent to use **TAM MCP Server's AlphaVantage tools** instead of Alpaca's limited data endpoint.

### What Changed

#### 1. Updated System Prompt (`agent/core.py`)
**Before:**
```
1. Analyze market conditions using get_market_data
```

**After:**
```
MARKET DATA TOOLS (via TAM MCP Server):
- alphaVantage_getCompanyOverview - Get company fundamentals
- alphaVantage_searchSymbols - Search for stock symbols
- get_latest_quote - Get current prices (from Alpaca)
- fred_getSeriesObservations - Economic indicators
- market_forecasting - Market trend predictions

1. Analyze market conditions using TAM tools (alphaVantage_getCompanyOverview, get_latest_quote)
```

#### 2. Updated Periodic Market Check (`agent/core.py`)
**Before:**
```python
2. Use get_market_data to check for opportunities
```

**After:**
```python
2. Use get_latest_quote to check prices for SPY, QQQ
3. Use alphaVantage_getCompanyOverview for fundamental analysis
Remember: Alpaca's get_market_data has subscription limits - use TAM tools
```

## New Testing Commands Added

### `/test-trade` - Test Trade Execution
**Usage:**
```
/test-trade AAPL buy 1
/test-trade SPY sell 5
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a test trade with 0.50 confidence (triggers approval flow)
- Tests the complete trade execution pipeline
- Verifies hook system works
- Shows approval/rejection flow

**Expected Flow:**
1. Command submitted
2. Agent prepares trade (0.50 confidence)
3. Hook intercepts (confidence < 0.85 threshold)
4. Approval request appears in Slack
5. User must approve (via chat or future button system)
6. Trade executes to Alpaca
7. Confirmation appears in Slack

---

### `/check-orders` - Check Order Status
**Usage:**
```
/check-orders
```

**What it does:**
- Gets current portfolio positions
- Shows recent account activity
- Lists pending orders
- Shows filled orders

**Returns:**
- Portfolio value and positions
- Recent trades
- Order statuses (pending, filled, cancelled)

---

## What Works Now

### ‚úÖ Market Data Access
- Agent can get stock prices via `get_latest_quote` (Alpaca quotes are free)
- Agent can get company fundamentals via TAM's `alphaVantage_getCompanyOverview`
- Agent can search symbols via TAM's `alphaVantage_searchSymbols`
- Agent can access economic indicators via TAM's FRED tools

### ‚úÖ Testing Commands
- `/test-trade` - Manually trigger test trades
- `/check-orders` - Verify orders and positions
- Both integrated with agent's tool system

### ‚úÖ Hook System
- Pre-trade hook intercepts all trades
- Checks confidence threshold (0.85)
- Requests approval for medium confidence trades
- Auto-executes high confidence trades
- Blocks trades that violate risk limits

---

## What Still Needs Work

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Slack Approval Buttons (Priority 1)
**Current State:**
- Hook requests approval via text message
- User cannot click button to approve/reject
- Must approve via text chat (not ideal)

**What's Needed:**
```python
# Add Slack Block Kit buttons
await say(
    text="Trade Approval Request",
    blocks=[
        {
            "type": "section",
            "text": {"type": "mrkdwn", "text": approval_message}
        },
        {
            "type": "actions",
            "elements": [
                {"type": "button", "text": "‚úÖ Approve", "action_id": "approve_trade"},
                {"type": "button", "text": "‚ùå Reject", "action_id": "reject_trade"}
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```

**Challenge:**
- Hook system is synchronous
- Slack approval is asynchronous
- Need to bridge the two (use futures or callback mechanism)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Order Fill Notifications (Priority 2)
**Current State:**
- Orders execute silently
- No notification when filled
- Must manually check `/check-orders`

**What's Needed:**
```python
# Background task to monitor orders
async def monitor_orders():
    while running:
        orders = trading_client.get_orders(status="open")

        for order in orders:
            if order.status == "filled" and not_notified:
                await slack_bot.send_fill_notification(order)

        await asyncio.sleep(10)
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automatic Opportunity Detection (Priority 3)
**Current State:**
- Agent runs periodic checks (every 5 mins)
- Analyzes market conditions
- But no actual trading strategies implemented yet

**What's Needed:**
- Implement actual trading strategies (RSI, momentum, etc.)
- Strategy evaluation logic
- Trade signal generation
- Risk/reward assessment

---

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Market Data Access ‚úÖ
```
1. Restart agent: python main.py
