## ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 1: INTELLIGENT TRADING STRATEGIES (2-3 days)
**Goal:** Move from infrastructure to actual profitable trading

### 1.1 Strategy Library Implementation
**Why:** Agent has no actual trading strategies yet - just framework

**Strategies to Implement:**
```
âœ“ Mean Reversion (RSI-based)
  - Buy oversold stocks (RSI < 30)
  - Sell overbought (RSI > 70)
  - Use TAM sentiment data for confirmation

âœ“ Momentum Trading
  - Breakout detection above resistance
  - Volume confirmation (TAM market data)
  - Trailing stops for trend following

âœ“ Sector Rotation
  - Use TAM industry_analysis to identify hot sectors
  - Rotate capital into strongest performers
  - Exit weak sectors early

âœ“ Economic Indicator Trading
  - Use FRED data (via TAM) for macro signals
  - Fed rate decisions â†’ market positioning
  - GDP, inflation â†’ sector allocation

âœ“ News-Driven Trading
  - AlphaVantage sentiment (via TAM)
  - Earnings surprise reactions
  - Economic event trading
```

**Files to Create:**
- `strategies/mean_reversion.py`

@app.command("/scan")
async def scan_opportunities():
    # Use TAM tools:
    # 1. Get top movers (AlphaVantage)
    # 2. Check sentiment scores
    # 3. Analyze sectors (TAM industry_analysis)
    # 4. Return top 5 opportunities with confidence scores
